                This study is a brief examination of the methodological
                challenges and general quality of freely-available data about
                feral swine (Sus scrofa) population in the United States. I
                conducted this review with the principles of evidential culture
                in mind, seeking to determine if information shared freely
                online might qualify as a contribution to open evidential
                culture, and whether professional researchers operating within
                open or closed evidential frameworks might benefit from informal
                information online.
              </p>
              <p class="mx-auto">
                Through systematic review of publicly available data sources,
                including state wildlife agencies, agricultural departments, and
                specialized hunting resources, I identified significant
                inconsistencies in estimation methodologies, reporting
                standards, and data accessibility. Findings reveal wide
                variations in population reporting formats, from single-point
                estimates to broad numerical ranges, complicating cross-state
                comparisons.
              </p>
              <p class="mx-auto">
                I conclude that developing standardized population estimation
                protocols, improving coordination between state agencies, would
                be a worthwhile but difficult goal. To help reach that goal,
                universities could work together to establish best-practices
                that might one day be accepted as policy, by establishing
                transparent data sharing mechanisms like those at The University
                of Georgia's Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health's
                Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS). Their
                efforts demonstrate how researchers might effectively harness
                amateur contributions to draw reliable conclusions, bridging the
                gap between open and closed evidential cultures. and more
                universities should follow their example.

          <p class="mx-auto">
            I began my literature review by examining publicly available
            resources on feral swine populations across the United States. My
            search focused on government agencies, university extension
            services, and specialized hunting resources that provide population
            data.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            <img

              class="swine-image-two"
            />
            The literature reveals a striking lack of methodological consistency
            in how feral swine populations are monitored and reported. While the
            biological and ecological dimensions of the feral swine lifecycle
            have received substantial scholarly attention, considerably less
            research has focused on the methodological challenges inherent in
            population monitoring and the resulting data inconsistencies.
            Studies have attempted to quantify feral swine populations at state
            or regional levels using various methodologies, including camera
            trapping (Massei et al., 2018), mark-recapture techniques (Hanson et
            al., 2008), and aerial surveys (Campbell et al., 2010). However,
            these approaches vary significantly in their implementation,
            accuracy, and geographic coverage. The resulting heterogeneity in
            population estimation methodologies creates substantial challenges
            for policymakers and wildlife managers attempting to allocate
            resources effectively or evaluate management success (or failure)
            across jurisdictional boundaries.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            I have limited access to studies that can be found behind paywalls,
            but it seems clear that there are no consistent standards to
            determine how population data for feral swine should be collected,
            reported, and utilized across different states and agencies. This
            knowledge gap impedes the development of coordinated management
            strategies and prevents accurate assessment of population trends at
            regional or national scales. It also prevents researchers from
            effectively combining their data and perhaps reaching useful
            conclusions.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
            maintains some of the most comprehensive data on feral swine
            distribution but offers limited granularity on population sizes.
            State wildlife agencies vary dramatically in their approaches, with
            some providing detailed population estimates (Texas, Florida) while
            others offer only vague qualitative assessments (North Carolina,
            Oklahoma).
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            This review identified a significant gap in the literature regarding
            standardized methodologies for feral swine population assessment
            across jurisdictional boundaries, highlighting the need for improved
            coordination between researchers and management agencies.

            I selected feral swine (Sus scrofa (feral type) Linnaeus) as the
            focus of this case study because they represent a significant
            ecological and agricultural challenge in the United States, with an
            estimated population exceeding 6 million. Recognized as one of the
            world's most destructive invasive species, these animals pose
            substantial threats to agricultural ecosystems and rural economies.
            Their rapid spread across the country and the various management
            approaches employed by different states make them an ideal subject
            for examining how data is collected, reported, and shared across
            jurisdictional boundaries.
          </p>

          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The case of feral swine population data is particularly suitable for
            investigating questions of evidential culture because it sits at the
            intersection of multiple stakeholder interestsâ€”including government
            agencies, academic researchers, agricultural producers, and
            recreational huntersâ€”each with different approaches to data
            collection and sharing. This diversity of approaches creates natural
            variation in evidential standards that can be analyzed and compared.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            Data for this case study was collected online, mostly from sources
            that are freely available to the general public. Since my goal is to
            show how useful data might be found online, it makes sense to look
            for information sources that are available to the general public
            whose efforts I hope to encourage.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            I systematically reviewed websites of state wildlife agencies,
            agricultural departments, university extension services, and
            specialized hunting resources across states with known feral swine
            populations. For each source, I documented the type of population
            data provided, the methodology used for estimation (if disclosed),
            the frequency of updates, and the accessibility of raw data.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            It is also useful to consider that as wild animals, feral swine are
            resistant to being tracked and counted, and their behaviors change
            when they are hunted. Falyn Owens, a wildlife biologist with the
            North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, explained that "We
            don't in North Carolina have a good estimate of the population of
            feral swine across the state because it's a really, really hard
            number to pin down."

              What seems to be the best of the current approaches, for research
              purposes, relies heavily on reported observations and consistent
              documentation. The University of Georgia's Center for Invasive
              Species and Ecosystem Health's Early Detection & Distribution
              Mapping System (EDDMapS) offers records dated July 1, 1982, to
              October 30, 2024, and include validated data entered by informed
              observers and made freely available to everyone on their

        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          In my review of publicly available feral swine population data, I
          found striking inconsistencies across state and federal resources. The
          data landscape resembles a patchwork quilt of methodologies and
          reporting standards rather than a coherent national framework.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          Texas Parks and Wildlife Department reports "about 2.6 million" feral
          swine, while Georgia's Department of Natural Resources provides a
          broad range of "200,000 to 600,000." Florida's Fish and Wildlife
          Conservation Commission simply states "over one-half million." These
          variations in reporting formatâ€”from single-point estimates to wide
          numerical rangesâ€”make meaningful cross-state comparisons nearly
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          Terminology also varies significantly. Arkansas Department of
          Agriculture tracks "removal" data, while Louisiana refers to
          "harvesting," and Oklahoma uses "take" figures. These seemingly minor
          semantic differences often reflect fundamentally different data
          collection methodologies.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          Even more concerning is the scarcity of methodological transparency.
          Few state agencies disclose their estimation techniques, and when they
          do, they rarely provide sufficient detail to evaluate reliability.
          North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission candidly admits they lack
          a "good estimate" because it's "a really, really hard number to pin
          down."
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          Viewing this data landscape through the lens of evidential culture
          reveals a tension between open and closed approaches. State wildlife
          agencies generally operate within closed evidential
          frameworksâ€”restricting access to raw data and methodological
          detailsâ€”while hunting organizations and citizen science platforms
          represent more open approaches.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          The University of Georgia's EDDMapS exemplifies a middle ground,
          utilizing citizen reports while maintaining scientific rigor through
          expert verification. This hybrid approach suggests that bridging open
          and closed evidential cultures may offer the most promising path
          forward.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          The current fragmentation impedes effective management and research.
          Without standardized metrics adjusted for state size, habitat
          availability, and agricultural distribution, raw population figures
          provide an incomplete picture of invasion intensity and associated
          impacts.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          My findings reveal that the current state of feral swine population
          data represents a missed opportunity for collaborative research and
          management. The inconsistencies I've documented don't merely reflect
          technical challenges in counting elusive animalsâ€”they reveal deeper
          divisions in evidential cultures across institutions.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          This fragmentation significantly hampers our ability to develop
          coordinated, evidence-based management strategies. When Georgia
          reports "200,000 to 600,000" feral swine while neighboring Florida
          states "over one-half million," policymakers lack the comparable data
          needed to allocate resources effectively across state boundaries.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          The proliferation of hunting-focused websites has paradoxically both
          helped and hindered public knowledge. While these sites often provide
          accessible and visually compelling data presentations, their
          scientific utility is limited by inconsistent source attribution and
          verification standards.

            My analysis supports previous research by Campbell et al. (2010) and
            Hanson et al. (2008) who identified methodological inconsistencies
            in wildlife population monitoring. However, my findings extend this
            work by specifically documenting how these inconsistencies manifest
            in publicly available data sources across jurisdictional boundaries.
            The current situation creates isolated repositories of information
            that cannot be meaningfully integrated or understood.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The biological and behavioral characteristics of feral swineâ€”their
            adaptability, nocturnal habits, and responses to hunting
            pressureâ€”create inherent challenges in population estimation.
            However, these natural difficulties are compounded by institutional
            and methodological fragmentation. When Georgia reports a population
            range of "200,000 to 600,000" while neighboring Florida simply
            states "over one-half million," the utility of such figures for
            cross-state management planning is severely limited.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            This study has several limitations worth acknowledging. First, I
            focused exclusively on publicly available online resources, which
            may not reflect the full scope of data available to wildlife
            managers through internal channels, or to experts in universities
            who have access to professional journals and data sites. Second, my
            analysis was limited to English-language resources, potentially
            missing valuable contributions from international research on feral
            swine management. Finally, the rapidly evolving nature of online
            resources means that some data sources may have been updated since
            my review.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            Despite these limitations, my findings clearly indicate that the
            current state of feral swine population data represents a missed
            opportunity for collaborative research and management. The
            University of Georgia's EDDMapS demonstrates how researchers can
            effectively bridge open and closed evidential cultures by harnessing
            amateur contributions while maintaining scientific rigor through
            expert verification.
