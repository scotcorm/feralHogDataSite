                This study is a brief examination of the methodological
                challenges and reporting discrepancies in freely-available data
                about feral swine (Sus scrofa) population in the United States.
                Through systematic review of publicly available data sources,
                including state wildlife agencies, agricultural departments, and
                specialized hunting resources, I identified significant
                inconsistencies in estimation methodologies, reporting
                standards, and data accessibility. Findings reveal wide
                variations in population reporting formats, from single-point
                estimates to broad numerical ranges, complicating cross-state
                comparisons. I conclude that developing standardized population
                estimation protocols, improving coordination between state
                agencies, and establishing transparent data sharing mechanisms
                are essential for improving feral swine population monitoring
                and management effectiveness.

            Feral swine (Sus scrofa (feral type) Linnaeus) represent a
            significant ecological and agricultural challenge in the United
            States, with an estimated population exceeding 6 million. Recognized
            as one of the world's most destructive invasive species, these
            animals pose substantial threats to agricultural ecosystems and
            rural economies [1, 2].
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            While the biological and ecological dimensions of the feral swine
            invasion have received substantial scholarly attention, considerably
            less research has focused on the methodological challenges inherent
            in population monitoring and the resulting data inconsistencies that
            complicate management efforts. Studies have attempted to quantify
            feral swine populations at state or regional levels using various
            methodologies, including camera trapping (Massei et al., 2018),
            mark-recapture techniques (Hanson et al., 2008), and aerial surveys
            (Campbell et al., 2010). However, these approaches vary
            significantly in their implementation, accuracy, and geographic
            coverage. The resulting heterogeneity in population estimation
            methodologies creates substantial challenges for policymakers and
            wildlife managers attempting to allocate resources effectively or
            evaluate management success across jurisdictional boundaries. [2b,
            2c, 2d]
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            I have limited access to studies that can be found behind paywalls,
            but it seems clear that there are no standards to determine how
            population data for feral swine should be collected, reported, and
            utilized across different states and agencies. This knowledge gap
            impedes the development of coordinated management strategies and
            prevents accurate assessment of population trends at regional or
            national scales. It also prevents researchers from effectively
            combining their data and perhaps reaching useful conclusions.

            The objective of this article is to systematically examine the

            United States. My focus is on research information that is readily
            available to members of the public who search for information on the

            As wild animals, feral swine are resistant to being tracked and
            counted, and their behaviors change when they are hunted. Falyn
            Owens, a wildlife biologist with the North Carolina Wildlife
            Resources Commission, explained that "We don't in North Carolina
            have a good estimate of the population of feral swine across the
            state because it's a really, really hard number to pin down"[3].

              What seems to be the best of the current approaches, for research
              purposes, relies heavily on reported observations and consistent
              documentation. The University of Georgia's Center for Invasive
              Species and Ecosystem Health's Early Detection & Distribution
              Mapping System (EDDMapS) offers records dated July 1, 1982, to
              October 30, 2024, and include validated data entered by informed
              observers and made freely available to everyone on their
              website.[4].

            Lack of standardization is causing researchers to miss
            opportunities, and data gathered about feral hogs is not always
            useful. For example, Texas has a high number of sightings, and a
            large population. The data does not adjust for the fact that Texas
            is the largest state.
          </p>
          <ol class="px-5 list-group list-group-numbered">
            <li class="list-group-item border border-0">
              The Arkansas Department of Agriculture records "removal" data on
              the number of feral hogs that are killed, but other states refer
              to killing hogs with different labels, such as "harvesting," or do
              not track deaths at all.[5]
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item border border-0">
              How population data is formatted is also important, especially if
              we are comparing results from one state to another:

              <p>
                Texas reports "about 2.6 million" feral swine,[6] Georgia
                estimates "200,000 to 600,000",[7] Florida indicates "over
                one-half million."[8] If some report the high data, some the
                low, others what is observed, and still others the estimated
                number or a range for the population data, then it is much
                harder for researchers to compile existing data and come to
                conclusions.

            <li class="list-group-item border border-0">
              Some of the most interesting materials that I found online were
              charts and graphs from hunting sites. While such sources may
              provide valuable insights, they often lack rigorous scientific
              documentation and verifiability. Comparative analysis of multiple
              sources, including specialized hunting websites and state-level
              reports, reveals significant differences, while also showing the
              challenges and potential in feral swine population tracking.

          </ol>
          <p class="pb-2 py-5">
            The proliferation of hunting-focused websites has contributed
            significantly to public knowledge about feral swine populations.
            While sites such as those maintained by recreational hunting
            organizations [9, 10] provide accessible and well-organized data
            presentations, their utility for academic research is limited by
            inconsistent source attribution. This limitation is particularly
            noteworthy given that at least one of these resources was cited by a
            news media outlet, potentially propagating unverified data.[20] The
            graph below presents a compilation of feral swine population
            estimates derived from publicly available sources, with particular
            attention to documentation provided to the public by state and
            federal agencies. While this approach prioritizes accessibility and
            transparency, it necessarily excludes potentially valuable data
            sources hidden behind paywalls, which would be available to students
            and professional researchers.

          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The study of feral swine populations is important, and requires
            continued methodological refinement to allow the development of
            coordinated, evidence-based strategies. The biological and
            behavioral characteristics of feral swine—their adaptability,
            elusive nature, and behavioral responses to hunting pressure—create
            inherent difficulties in population estimation that transcend
            conventional wildlife monitoring approaches.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The divergent metrics employed by different states—from precise
            numerical estimates to broad ranges, from active monitoring to
            passive reporting—create a fragmented data landscape that precludes
            meaningful aggregation and comparison. This inconsistency extends to
            basic terminology, with states variously tracking "removal,"
            "harvest," or "take" data with different methodological approaches.
            Raw population figures, when not adjusted for state size, habitat
            availability, or agricultural distribution, provide an incomplete
            picture of invasion intensity and associated ecological and economic
            impacts. A more standardized approach is needed: one that takes
            advantage of non-traditional data sources, particularly those from
            recreational hunting platforms.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The University of Georgia's Early Detection & Distribution Mapping
            System (EDDMapS) is the most promising approach to feral swine
            monitoring that I have found so far, in that it leverages validated
            observational data from diverse sources. If more universities could
            provide ways for interdisciplinary collaborators like farmers and
            hunters to supply usable data, and cooperate to standardize
            reporting, then research experts could then compile and study the
            results to reach conclusions, and everyone would benefit.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The feral swine invasion represents a complex ecological, economic,
            and methodological challenge that requires coordinated response
            across multiple domains. While perfect population estimation may
            remain elusive, significant improvements in data quality,
            consistency, and utility are achievable through collaborative
            approaches that span disciplinary and geographical boundaries.
